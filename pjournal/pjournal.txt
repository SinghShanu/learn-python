Apparently, mathematically he worked out that just using 6 or so numbers/spaces, he could solve any mathematical problem. This obviously gave rise then to mechanical computers which would emulate these 6 conditions to solve complex problems, and then eventually to the invention of a transister which holds the value either 1 or 0, true or false, and before that all those complex punch boards, then eventually to computer machine code. AMAZING...so going to find out more about this...what I've written is probably WRONG lol. Goodbye pjournal for now x']
